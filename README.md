## Overview

This project covers the entire machine learning lifecycle:
1. **Data Ingestion & Processing**: Raw data is stored in versioned directories and transformed for training.  
2. **Model Development**: Multiple models are tested and tracked with experiment management tools (e.g., MLFlow).  
3. **Logging & Monitoring**: Comprehensive logs are kept for debugging and performance monitoring.  
4. **Deployment**: A Flask or FastAPI application (via `application.py`) serves predictions in real time.

## 2. Create & Activate a Virtual Environment (recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate      # On Linux/Mac
.\venv\Scripts\activate       # On Windows
```


## 3.Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip

pip install -r requirements.txt

```

##Set Up Environment Variables (if needed)

Configure paths, API keys, or credentials in a .env file or in your shell environment.

# Usage
## 1.Data Processing & Model Training

Run the main pipeline (example):

```bash
python -m pipeline.training_pipeline.

```

## 2.Run the Application

Start the Flask or FastAPI server:

 
```bash
python application.py
```
Go to http://127.0.0.1:5000 (or specified port) to access the web interface.

## 3.Experiment Tracking

If using MLFlow, start the UI:

```bash
mlflow ui
```

Visit http://127.0.0.1:5000 (default MLFlow port) to track experiments, metrics, and artifacts.


# Running the Flask App
Start the Flask web application:

```bash
python app/main.py
```
The app will be available at http://127.0.0.1:5000 for real-time reservation prediction.

## CI/CD with Jenkins
Configure a Jenkins pipeline that:

Checks out the code.

Installs dependencies.

Runs tests.

Executes the training pipeline.

Optionally, build a Docker image and deploy to GCP.

## Deployment on GCP
Google Cloud Run:

Containerize the Flask app using a Dockerfile.

Deploy using:

```bash
gcloud run deploy
```
## Google Cloud Storage:

Use GCS buckets for storing raw and processed data, as well as model artifacts.

## Monitoring & Logging:

Utilize Google Cloud Logging and Monitoring for performance tracking.
